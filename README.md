# Quiz Application
## Problems
1) When I press start quiz the quz questions and options should only be displayed, and the timer should start counting down
2) When I get a question right at the bottom it should have a pop up display of correct and then dissapear, vice versa for when a question is wrong.
3) If a question is wrong there needs to be an added penalty of time deduction
4) When time reaches zero end quiz regardless of whether if all question were finished
5) if questions are finished
